The tweet card is responsible for displaying information about the user and
their social activity, such as the number of tweets and followers. It also
contains the Tweets, Followers, and ButtonFollow components, which are
responsible for displaying the number of tweets and followers, as well as an
interactive "Follow" button that can be clicked to follow the user. The
component also stores data about whether you are following the user in
localStorage so that it persists even after the page is reloaded.
